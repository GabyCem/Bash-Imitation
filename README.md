# Bash-Imitation

This project is about an imitation of part of the bash capabilities.

The program will have these abilities:

* When the program is working a '$' will appear and a user can write his command.
* The user can use the CD command to switch between folders.
* The user can use the HISTORY command to get a list of all the commands he already used and their status (Running or not).
* The user can use the JOBS command to get a list of the programs that are currently running (background and foreground).
* Other commands are implemented with the exec command - then the command will run by the OS.
